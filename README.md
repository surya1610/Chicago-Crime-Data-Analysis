# Chicago-Crime-Data-Analysis
This notebook is a Spark and Python learner's to perform data analysis on some real-world data set.

In this notebook, I am using Spark, Pandas, MongoDB, Matplotlib, Seaborn for implementing the pipeline. The point is:

Performed data reading using MongoDB, transforming, and querying using Apache Spark, Visualize using existing Python libraries.

Project objective is to predict the crime type using all the details of the crime as features
Visualizing different trends and analyzing the crime data over a time period.
Implementing various ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, DTree classifier, Random Forest classifier to find out which algorithm with the best parameters gives out the best accuracy.
Predicting and advising the optimal model for crime detection based on various times and other features from the analysis of the dataset.

# Data Descripton
The dataset selected for this research comprises of crime reports from 2001 to 2019 for the city of Chicago. Data is taken from the CLEAR system of the Chicago Police Department. It is one of the most comprehensive data sources on crime. The dataset has sufficient data regarding the crime's Date, Type, Description, location, etc. for our study.
